# OpenSCAD Things
Repository for my OpenSCAD files of things I've created.

### [20x20mm Diagnostic Cube](20mm_test_cube.scad)

A pretty standard 2 centimeter cubed prism with a missing corner for testing your 3D printer.

### [Arrow Display Mount](arrow_display_mount.scad)

A parametric block that can be attached to a wall to hold three arrows up for display. The shape is calculated using real life measurements of the arrows, desired distance between fletching, and other variables that make this print exactly perfect.

### [Parametric CPU Delidder Tool](cpu_delid_tool.scad)

Customizable tool used to delid a processor before applying liquid metal TIM. Use the parameters to make this fit your processor. After printing, place your processor in the tray of the larger printed half. Lay the top cover over the IHS of the processor with the cutout closer to the wider side of the cover flush against the side of the CPU's IHS, leaving a gap on either side of the two parts. The tops of each piece should be flush with eachother. Use a C-clamp or equivalent to gently sandwich the CPU between the printed parts, enough pressure to hold them in place when the ends of the tool are pressed together, sliding the IHS off the die.
